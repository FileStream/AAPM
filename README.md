# ADVANCED ARMOR PLATE MOD

## TERMS OF USE:

* The mod is **open-source**. Modify it, redistribute it, host it. *Do whatever you please*. We actually care about the community having a good experience, not our own copyright.
* AAPM is benched for people with an IQ in the triple digits. Remember that.
* You are **absolutely free to make use of AAPM for your server and/or unit**. Feel free to shoot V. Berlioz, Revolver Ocelot, Rancorusia, and/or Sysroot/FileStream a friend request if you have questions about the mod.
* **We are under no obligation to help you**. Requests come first-come-first-serve.

## IMPORTANT NOTES:

* AAPM has a policy where **if you can come forth with an interesting armor insert, it will be introduced in an upcoming update**. Priority will be given to obscure inserts over common ones, and all final calls are made by V. Berlioz.
* V. Berlioz is Project Lead, Revolver Ocelot is modeler, Rancorusia is additional config man. SonicT originally coded the very first versions of the mod by himself but his whereabouts have been unknown to us for over a month. Sysroot/FileStream has filled his position and has done extensive rewrites to the mod.
* **To access Mercenary Difficulty, move Mercenary_Difficulty.pbo and the corresponding key from Optional to Addons.**
